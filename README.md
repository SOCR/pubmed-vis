[SOCR](http://socr.umich.edu) PubMed Visualization
=========

The PubMed Navigator takes author, topic or title as a search term and retrieves the corresponding data of a specified search term from the PubMed API via AJAX calls. Then authors related to the search term are displayed using a collapsible force layout made by D3js. Double click on author's name performs another search and displays co-authors. Right click to search in google. List of corresponding papers is diplayed in the table at the bottom.
